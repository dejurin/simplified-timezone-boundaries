Boundaries of time zones fat-free.

# What's that?

The goal is to create a ready GeoJSON file with time zone boundaries in a simplified version to load as a layer on OSM maps.

Two wonderful repositories will help us to implement our project https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper and https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder (many thank authors for this job).
